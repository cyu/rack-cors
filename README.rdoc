= Rack CORS Middleware

Rack::Cors provides support for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for Rack compatible web applications.  The CORS spec allows web applications to make cross domain AJAX calls without
using workarounds such as JSONP.  For a thorough write up on CORS, see this blog post:

http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/05/25/cross-domain-ajax-with-cross-origin-resource-sharing/

Or for all the gory details, you can read the spec here:

http://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/#simple-cross-origin-request-and-actual-r


Install the gem:

  gem install rack-cors

In your Gemfile:

  gem 'rack-cors', :require => 'rack/cors'


== Configuration

You configure Rack::Cors by passing a block to the <tt>use</tt> command:

  use Rack::Cors do
    allow do
      origins 'localhost:3000', '127.0.0.1:3000',
              /http:\/\/192\.168\.0\.\d{1,3}(:\d+)?/
              # regular expressions can be used here

      resource '/file/list_all/', :headers => 'x-domain-token'
      resource '/file/at/*',
          :methods => [:get, :post, :put, :delete, :options],
          :headers => 'x-domain-token',
          :expose => ['Some-Custom-Response-Header']
          # headers to expose
    end

    allow do
      origins '*'
      resource '/public/*', :headers => :any, :methods => :get
    end
  end

Put your code in "config/application.rb" on your rails application. For example, this will allow
from any origins on any resource of your application, methods :get, :post and :options.

  module YourApp
    class Application < Rails::Application

      # ...

      config.middleware.use Rack::Cors do
        allow do
          origins '*'
          resource '*', :headers => :any, :methods => [:get, :post, :options]
        end
      end
      
    end
  end
